# Flexible Large Augmentable Time-of-flight (FLAT) Dataset

This repository accompanies provides access to the FLAT dataset and some proposed baseline methods on ToF artifacts removal. For details of the dataset and the methods, please refer to the [project page](https://research.nvidia.com/publication/2018-09_Tackling-3D-ToF). If you use this code in your work, please kindly cite the following paper:
